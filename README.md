Location Based Business Finder

Welcome to Location Based Business Finder, a Python-based web application designed to help users discover nearby businesses, such as restaurants, bukas, and pharmacies, with interactive maps and real-time navigation. Built using Streamlit and powered by Geoapify and Foursquare APIs, this project is tailored for Nigerian users, supporting local business categories like “buka” and “suya_spot.” The application features an intuitive interface, live location tracking, and turn-by-turn directions, all developed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for modularity and scalability.

Features

Find Nearby Businesses: Search for businesses by location (automatic via browser/IP or manual input) and category (e.g., “restaurant,” “buka”).
Nigerian-Specific Categories: Supports local terms like “catering.buka,” “catering.suya_spot,” and “commercial.petty_trader” for a tailored experience.
Interactive Maps: Visualize businesses on a Folium map with user and business markers connected by lines.
Turn-by-Turn Directions: Get detailed navigation instructions from your location to a selected business using Geoapify.
Live Location Tracking: Update directions in real-time as you move, leveraging browser geolocation.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for a seamless, browser-based experience.
Map Export: Save maps to static/map.html for offline viewing.
Robust Error Handling: Manages invalid inputs, API failures, and geolocation issues with clear feedback.

Demo

Run the app with streamlit run main.py.
Enter a location (e.g., “Wuye, Abuja”) or use automatic detection.
Search for a category (e.g., “buka”).
View businesses on an interactive map and click “Get Directions” for navigation.

Note: Live tracking works best on mobile devices with GPS enabled.
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/location-based-business-finder.git
cd location-based-business-finder


Set Up a Virtual Environment (recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install streamlit folium streamlit-folium streamlit-geolocation requests python-dotenv haversine


Configure API Keys:

Sign up for Geoapify and Foursquare to obtain API keys.
Create a .env file in the project root with the following:GEOAPIFY_API_KEY=your_geoapify_key
FOURSQUARE_API_KEY=your_foursquare_key





Usage

Launch the Application:
streamlit run main.py


This opens the app in your default browser (e.g., http://localhost:8501).


Search for Businesses:

Location: Select “Use my current location” for automatic detection (browser or IP-based) or enter an address manually (e.g., “Lagos, Nigeria”).
Business Type: Input a category (e.g., “buka,” “pharmacy”). The app uses fuzzy matching to handle variations or misspellings.
Click “Search Businesses” to view results.


Explore Results:

View businesses on an interactive Folium map with markers for your location (green) and businesses (red), connected by gray lines.
Browse a detailed list with business names, addresses, distances, ratings, and contact info (phone, email, website if available).
Expand the “Directions” section to select a travel mode (“walk” or “drive”) and click “Get Directions” for turn-by-turn instructions.
Enable live tracking to update directions as you move (ideal for mobile devices).


Export Map (Optional):

Save the map to static/map.html for offline viewing by enabling the save_map_html function in utils.py.

File Descriptions

config.py:

Manages API keys (Geoapify, Foursquare) and default settings (search radius: 1000m, default category: “restaurant,” limit: 10).
Loads keys from .env for security and provides defaults for consistent searches.


utils.py:

Offers utility functions: make_api_request for reliable API calls with retries, get_location_from_ip for IP-based geolocation, log_error for logging to business_finder.log, and save_map_html for exporting Folium maps.


location_manager.py:

Converts addresses (e.g., “Wuye, Abuja”) to coordinates using Geoapify’s geocoding API, returning latitude, longitude, and formatted address.


business_finder.py:

Searches for businesses near a location using Geoapify’s Places API, creates Business objects, and supports filtering by rating and sorting by distance.


business.py:

Represents a business with attributes (name, address, coordinates, etc.) and methods to fetch directions (Geoapify) and ratings (Foursquare).


constant.py:

Defines Geoapify categories, including Nigerian-specific ones (e.g., “catering.buka”), and fuzzy-matches user inputs to valid categories.


gui_manager.py:

Manages the Streamlit interface, handling location/category input, displaying interactive maps and business lists, and providing directions with live tracking.


main.py:

The entry point that launches the app by initializing GUIManager and calling run_app.
